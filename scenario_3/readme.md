Here we need to find the running median for the given list.

Scenario:

list1 = [4,5,20,3,6,33,7]

leave the first number 4. 

And when going to next number we will have 4,5 in the list. in this case we need to add them both and divide it with n which is 2.

further when we proceed to the next number, we will have 4,5,20. In this case we need to find the middle value. so we will take 5.

This goes on till the last number of the list. and we need to add the values up to get the running and slicing median of the list.
