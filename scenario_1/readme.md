This python program is used to find the first duplicate in the list.
scenario:
list1 = [2,3,4,3,5,6,2]

we need to pick the duplicate from the list. In the above case, 2 and 3 are duplicate values in the list.
But for the scenario we need to pick the first duplicate which is 3. 3 comes twice before the duplicate 2 happens.
